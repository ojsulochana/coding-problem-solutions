# coding-problem-solutions

I created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a good problem solving software engineer. This inspires me to code regularly and keep me hands on with the DS/Algo skills

I read about 1-2 hours a day for new topics and try to pull out the solution for the problem.

This is my story: Practising the approaches would keep you retain the skills needed and implementing the same would enhance your coding skills.

Happy Coding :)
